# Dickinson Portfolio

### Description
The goal of this project is to make a portfolio of work to show off my skills to employers. The project needs to be deployed and have functionality and creativity. For this task i was asked to make a web application that has my name, a recent photo and a nav bar that links to sections. The nav bar need to be clickable and bring you to each section. The work section needs to have photos with titles connected to them. The photos should also be clickable that brings you to a deployed project. The screen should also have a resposive layout.

## The process


### What i did
* Created a header that has a title and a nav bar that uses A tags to link to each section using id tags
* Created a hero that goes under the header 
* Made two sections in the main one about me and one with my work
* Both sections have a header that was floated to the side and the content on the right
* The work section has 5 images that say coming soon because i have no work
* Each image was sized down to all be equal except the first image being larger
* Headings were added to each image and connected using absolute placement
* The footer was made with the same format as the two above having the heading floated and the content aside
* The footer has links to my phone number emaila nd github
* I used media queries to have the headings go above the content and had the content line up in a column
